    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working on becoming a well known business women with full respect and high loyalty. The experiences that have led me here are the ones of having my mother stand strong on her ground when working with customers and coworkers that have tried to be disrespectful but then ended up feeling like a fool in front of her because she never let any one second guess her work standards and her ways of doing things. 

I am working on these goals by having confidence in anything I feel strongly about and not listening to the others that consider it a "terrible idea" or say that it will never work. I am also working hard on different ideas to see what works best in their own different ways. 

The values I consider most necessary for my success are staying strong and confident for everything I do or say to others and myself. 

My short-term goals I hope I accomplish in the near future are having the best grades and best attitude for starting new things in life. 

The character traits I want to be known for are being a loyal, kind and honest person. The achievements I most want to be known for are having a big house, having my own company/business and doing all of my work the right way.</p>
